Question,Answer
"ï»¿1. **Vendor Contact**: ""Does the privacy policy clearly indicate whether users can contact the vendor with questions complaints or about material changes to the policy?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does provide contact information for WhatsApp Ireland Limited, including an address for the Data Protection Officer, which users can use to contact the vendor with questions about the privacy policy. However, it does not explicitly mention how users can contact the vendor with complaints or about material changes to the policy. For full compliance, the policy should clearly state that users can contact the vendor with complaints and provide a method for users to be informed about material changes to the policy."
"2. **Quick Reference**: ""Does the privacy policy provide a clear summary of the vendor's privacy principles using short explanations layered notices a table of contents or an outline?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does include a table of contents and mentions key updates, which can help users navigate the document. However, the policy is extremely lengthy and dense, making it difficult to quickly reference or understand the vendor's privacy principles. The use of short explanations and layered notices is not evident, which would be necessary for full compliance with GDPR's transparency and clarity requirements."
"3. **Children Intended (BASIC)**: ""Does the privacy policy state whether the product is intended for children under the age of 13?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy mentions that the minimum age requirement for using WhatsApp in the European Region has been reduced from 16 to 13, ensuring a consistent minimum age requirement globally. However, it does not explicitly state whether the product is intended for children under the age of 13. This lack of explicit clarification makes the policy only partially compliant with the requirement to state whether the product is intended for children under the age of 13."
"4. **Teens Intended**: ""Does the privacy policy state whether the product is intended for teenagers aged 13 to 18?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy mentions that the minimum age requirement for using WhatsApp in the European Region has been reduced from 16 to 13, ensuring a consistent minimum age requirement globally. However, it does not explicitly state whether the product is specifically intended for teenagers aged 13 to 18. The policy should ideally include a clear statement about the intended age group to fully comply with GDPR requirements regarding transparency and clarity."
"5. **Adults Intended**: ""Does the privacy policy state whether the product is intended for adults over the age of 18?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does not explicitly state that the product is intended for adults over the age of 18. However, it does mention that users must be of legal capacity to enter into an enforceable contract, which generally implies being an adult. Additionally, the policy references a minimum age requirement of 13 for the European Region, which is not specific to adults. Therefore, the policy is partially compliant as it indirectly addresses age requirements but does not clearly state that the product is intended for adults over 18."
"6. **Collect PII (BASIC)**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor collects personally identifiable information (PII)?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does specify that the vendor collects personally identifiable information (PII). It mentions the collection of various types of information, such as mobile phone numbers, profile names, and other account information. However, the policy is not very clear or detailed in its explanation of all the types of PII collected. It could benefit from a more explicit and comprehensive list of the PII collected to ensure full transparency and compliance with GDPR requirements."
"7. **PII Categories**: ""Does the privacy policy list the categories of personally identifiable information that are collected?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does list various categories of personally identifiable information (PII) that are collected, such as:

- Account Information (e.g., mobile phone number, profile name)
- User Content (e.g., messages, media within messages, calls)
- Status Information
- Precise Location Information
- Connections (e.g., phone numbers from the device address book)
- Community and Group Information
- Customer Support Information and Communications
- Automatically Collected Information (e.g., usage information, log and troubleshooting information, device connection information, general location information, cookies)
- Authentication Information
- Information from Third Parties

However, the policy is somewhat fragmented and lacks a clear, consolidated list of all PII categories in one place, which can make it difficult for users to easily understand what types of personal data are being collected. For full compliance, a more organized and user-friendly presentation of the PII categories would be beneficial."
"8. **Geolocation Data**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether precise geolocation data are collected?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does specify that precise geolocation data are collected when users choose to use location-related features, such as sharing their current location or sending live location to contacts. It also mentions that this data is end-to-end encrypted and that users can control the sharing of this information through in-app settings and device-based settings.

However, the policy does not provide detailed information on how long this data is retained or the specific purposes for which it is used beyond the immediate sharing with contacts. For full compliance, the policy should include more comprehensive details on the retention period and all purposes for which precise geolocation data are processed."
"9. **Health Data**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether any health or biometric data are collected?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does not explicitly mention the collection of health or biometric data. However, it does mention the processing of photos to suggest avatars, which could involve biometric data. The policy should explicitly state whether health or biometric data are collected and how they are processed to be fully compliant with GDPR requirements for transparency and specificity."
"10. **Behavioral Data**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether any behavioral data are collected?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does mention the collection of ""Usage Information,"" which includes details about how users interact with the services, such as activity, time, frequency, and duration of activities. This can be considered behavioral data. However, the policy does not explicitly label this as ""behavioral data,"" nor does it provide a detailed explanation of how this data is used or processed. For full compliance, the policy should clearly specify that behavioral data is collected and provide more detailed information on its use."
"11. **Sensitive Data**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether sensitive personal information is collected?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does not explicitly mention the collection of sensitive personal information, such as racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, health data, or data concerning a person's sex life or sexual orientation. However, it does mention the collection of various types of personal information, including account information, user content, and device information, among others. 

For full GDPR compliance, the policy should explicitly state whether sensitive personal data is collected and, if so, provide details on the legal basis for processing such data and the specific protections in place."
"12. **Usage Data**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the product automatically collects any information?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does specify that the product automatically collects information, including usage information, log and troubleshooting information, device connection information, and general location information. However, the policy is not very clear or detailed in explaining the specific types of usage data collected and how it is used. For full compliance with GDPR, the policy should provide more explicit details on the types of usage data collected, the purposes for which it is collected, and how it is processed."
"13. **Collection Limitation (BASIC)**: ""Does the privacy policy state that the vendor limits the collection or use of information to only data specifically required for the product?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does mention that WhatsApp collects information necessary to provide its services and that certain features require additional information, which users are notified about. However, the policy also indicates that a broad range of data is collected, including device-specific information, usage information, and information from third parties. While the policy states that some data collection is necessary for service provision, it does not explicitly limit the collection to only the data specifically required for the product. Therefore, it is only partially compliant with the GDPR's principle of data minimization."
"14. **Data Shared (BASIC)**: ""Does the privacy policy indicate if collected information including data collected via automated tracking or usage analytics is shared with third parties?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does indicate that collected information, including data collected via automated tracking or usage analytics, is shared with third parties. However, the policy lacks specific details on the types of third parties and the exact nature of the data shared. For full GDPR compliance, the policy should provide more transparency regarding the categories of third parties and the specific purposes for which the data is shared."
"15. **Sharing Purpose**: ""Does the privacy policy specify the vendor's purpose for sharing a user's personal information with third parties?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does specify some purposes for sharing a user's personal information with third parties, such as providing and improving services, ensuring safety and security, and complying with legal obligations. However, the policy is quite extensive and fragmented, making it difficult to ascertain if all purposes are clearly and comprehensively outlined. For full compliance, the policy should provide a more structured and detailed explanation of all purposes for sharing personal information with third parties."
"16. **Third-Party Analytics**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether collected information is shared with third parties for analytics and tracking purposes?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does mention that WhatsApp works with third-party service providers to help provide and improve services, which includes business analytics services. However, it does not explicitly state that collected information is shared with third parties specifically for analytics and tracking purposes. The policy could be clearer and more explicit about the sharing of information for these specific purposes to ensure full compliance with GDPR transparency requirements."
"17. **Exclude Sharing**: ""Does the privacy policy specify any categories of information that will not be shared with third parties?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does not explicitly specify any categories of information that will not be shared with third parties. While it details the types of information collected and the circumstances under which information may be shared, it does not clearly state any categories of information that are excluded from sharing with third parties. This lack of explicit exclusion makes the policy only partially compliant with the GDPR requirement for transparency regarding data sharing practices."
"18. **Data Acquired**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor may acquire a user's information from a third party?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does mention that WhatsApp may receive information from third parties, including other users, businesses, and third-party services. However, the policy does not provide detailed specifics on the types of third parties or the exact nature of the information acquired from them. For full compliance with GDPR, the policy should clearly specify the categories of third parties and the types of data that may be acquired from them."
"19. **Third-Party Categories**: ""Does the privacy policy specify the categories of third parties such as subsidiaries or affiliates with whom the vendor shares data?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does specify that WhatsApp shares data with third-party service providers and Meta Companies, including subsidiaries and affiliates. However, it does not provide a detailed list of the specific categories of third parties or the exact nature of these third parties. The policy mentions various types of third-party service providers (e.g., telecommunications technology providers, content safety technology service providers, location data providers) and the Meta Companies but lacks a comprehensive categorization of all third parties involved."
"20. **Data Deidentified**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether a user's information that is shared or sold to a third party is only done so in an anonymous or deidentified format?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does mention that certain information may be de-identified or anonymized, particularly in the context of operational retention needs and legal reasons. However, it does not explicitly state that all user information shared or sold to third parties is done so in an anonymous or deidentified format. The policy provides detailed information on data sharing practices but lacks a clear, overarching statement ensuring that all shared or sold data is anonymized or deidentified. This partial compliance indicates that while some measures are in place, the policy could be more explicit in addressing this concern comprehensively."
"21. **Deidentified Process**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the deidentification process is done with a reasonable level of justified confidence or provide links to any information that describes their deidentification process?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy mentions that copies of certain log records remain in the database disassociated from personal identifiers and that the account initially linked to these records is randomly generated. However, it does not explicitly state whether the deidentification process is done with a reasonable level of justified confidence, nor does it provide links to any information that describes their deidentification process in detail. This lack of explicit detail and external references makes the policy only partially compliant with GDPR requirements regarding deidentification."
"22. **Third-Party Limits (BASIC)**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor imposes contractual limits on how third parties can use personal information shared or sold to them?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy mentions that WhatsApp works with third-party service providers and requires them to use information on WhatsApp's behalf in accordance with instructions and terms. However, it does not explicitly state whether there are contractual limits imposed on how these third parties can use the personal information shared with them. The policy could be more explicit in detailing the contractual restrictions placed on third parties regarding the use of personal data."
"23. **Purpose Limitation**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor limits the use of data collected by the product to the purpose for which it was collected?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does mention that the data collected is used for various specified purposes, such as providing and improving services, ensuring security, and complying with legal obligations. However, it does not explicitly state that the use of data is strictly limited to the purposes for which it was originally collected. The policy outlines multiple purposes and legal bases for processing data, but a clear, overarching statement on purpose limitation is not present. This makes the policy partially compliant with the GDPR's purpose limitation principle."
"24. **Data Purpose**: ""Does the privacy policy specify the context or purpose for which data are collected?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does specify various contexts and purposes for which data are collected, such as creating and managing accounts, providing customer support, ensuring security, and enabling communication features. However, the policy is fragmented and lacks clear, concise sections that explicitly outline the purposes in a user-friendly manner. This could make it difficult for users to fully understand the specific contexts and purposes of data collection, which is a key requirement under GDPR for transparency."
"25. **Context Notice**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether notice is provided to a user if the vendor changes the context in which data are collected?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy mentions that WhatsApp may amend or update the Privacy Policy and will provide notice of amendments where appropriate. However, it does not explicitly state that users will be notified if the context in which data are collected changes. The policy states:

""may amend update Privacy Policy. provide notice amendments Privacy Policy, appropriate, update 'Last Updated' date top Privacy Policy.""

This indicates that users might be informed of changes to the policy itself, but it does not specifically address changes in the context of data collection. Therefore, the policy is only partially compliant with the requirement to notify users about changes in the context of data collection."
"26. **Context Consent**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor will obtain consent if the data collection practices change or are inconsistent with contractual requirements?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy mentions that users have the right to withdraw consent at any time and that the company will provide notice of amendments to the Privacy Policy, including updates to the ""Last Updated"" date. However, it does not explicitly state that the vendor will obtain consent if data collection practices change or are inconsistent with contractual requirements. This lack of explicit mention makes the policy only partially compliant with GDPR requirements regarding obtaining consent for changes in data collection practices."
"27. **Collection Consent**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor requests opt-in consent from a user at the time information is collected?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy mentions that certain information is collected based on user consent, such as sharing precise location information and accessing the camera/photo gallery. However, it does not explicitly state that opt-in consent is requested at the time of collection for all types of information. The policy should provide clearer details on how and when opt-in consent is obtained for various data collection activities to be fully compliant with GDPR requirements."
"28. **Complaint Notice**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor has a mechanism for users to file a complaint if their content or account is restricted or removed?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does mention that users have the right to lodge a complaint with WhatsApp's lead supervisory authority under GDPR, which is the Irish Data Protection Commission. However, it does not explicitly specify a mechanism for users to file a complaint directly with WhatsApp if their content or account is restricted or removed. The policy provides general information on exercising rights and managing information but lacks specific details on the complaint process for account or content restrictions."
"29. **Opt-Out Consent**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether a user can opt out from the disclosure or sale of their data to a third party?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does not explicitly mention whether users can opt out from the disclosure or sale of their data to third parties. However, it does provide some information on user rights and the ability to manage certain settings, such as privacy settings and blocking features. The policy also mentions that users can object to certain processing activities, but it does not clearly state if this includes opting out from data disclosure or sale to third parties. Therefore, while there are some mechanisms for user control, the policy lacks specific clarity on this particular aspect."
"30. **Disclosure Request**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether a user can request the vendor to provide all the personal information shared with third parties?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does mention that users have the right to access their information and provides a mechanism for users to request their account information through the in-app ""Request Account Info"" feature. However, it does not explicitly state that users can request the vendor to provide all the personal information shared with third parties. The policy should explicitly include this right to be fully compliant with GDPR's transparency and access requirements."
"31. **Disclosure Notice**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor will notify the affected user school parent or student in the event of a government or legal request for their information?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does mention that WhatsApp may share information with regulators, law enforcement, government agencies, and others in response to legal requests. However, it does not explicitly state that the affected user, school, parent, or student will be notified in the event of such a government or legal request for their information. This lack of explicit notification to the affected parties makes the policy only partially compliant with GDPR requirements regarding transparency and user rights."
"32. **Access Data (BASIC)**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor provides authorized individuals a method to access a user's personal information?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy mentions that users have the right to access their information and provides some details on how they can exercise this right, such as using the in-app ""Request Account Info"" feature. However, it does not explicitly state whether authorized individuals (e.g., data protection officers or other designated personnel) have a method to access a user's personal information. The policy could be more explicit in detailing the mechanisms and procedures for authorized individuals to access user data."
"33. **Restrict Access**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor provides mechanisms to restrict what data are accessible to specific users?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does mention mechanisms for users to manage and control their data, such as changing privacy settings, managing contacts, and using the ""block"" feature to manage communication within the services. However, it does not explicitly state whether the vendor provides mechanisms to restrict what data are accessible to specific users. The policy focuses more on user control over their own data and privacy settings rather than restricting access to specific data for different users."
"34. **Maintain Accuracy**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor takes steps to maintain the accuracy of the data they collect and store?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does mention some steps related to maintaining the accuracy of data, such as verifying accounts, checking operating system features, and running security checks to ensure the correct setup of WhatsApp on devices. However, it does not explicitly state a comprehensive approach or specific measures taken to ensure the ongoing accuracy of all data collected and stored. The policy could be more explicit in detailing how data accuracy is maintained throughout its lifecycle."
"35. **Data Modification (BASIC)**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor provides authorized individuals the ability to modify a user's inaccurate data?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy mentions that users have the right to access, rectify, port, and erase their information, as well as restrict or object to certain processing. It also provides tools for users to rectify, update, and delete information directly in-app. However, it does not explicitly state whether authorized individuals (other than the users themselves) have the ability to modify a user's inaccurate data. Therefore, while the policy addresses user rights to modify their own data, it lacks clarity on whether authorized individuals can do so."
"36. **Modification Process**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor provides a process for schools parents or eligible students to modify inaccurate student information?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does not explicitly mention a process for schools, parents, or eligible students to modify inaccurate student information. However, it does provide general information on how users can manage, change, limit, or delete their information through in-app settings and other tools. This suggests that there may be mechanisms in place for users to update their information, but it is not specifically tailored to the context of modifying inaccurate student information. Therefore, the policy is only partially compliant with this specific requirement."
"37. **Modification Notice**: ""Does the privacy policy specify how long the vendor has to modify a user's inaccurate data after notice is given?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does mention the right to rectify information and provides tools for users to rectify, update, or delete information directly in-app. However, it does not specify a clear timeframe within which the vendor must modify a user's inaccurate data after notice is given. This lack of a specific timeframe means the policy is only partially compliant with GDPR requirements regarding the rectification of inaccurate data."
"38. **Retention Policy**: ""Does the privacy policy specify the vendor's data retention policy including any data sunsets or time periods after which a user's data will be automatically deleted if inactive?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does specify the vendor's data retention policy, including the time periods after which a user's data will be automatically deleted if inactive. For example, it mentions that WhatsApp accounts are generally deleted after 120 days of inactivity and that undelivered messages are deleted from servers after 30 days. However, the policy also states that certain information may be retained for legal reasons or operational needs, which are not fully detailed. Therefore, while the policy provides some information on data retention and deletion, it lacks comprehensive details on all aspects of data retention and specific data sunsets."
"39. **Retention Limits**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor will limit the retention of a user's data unless a valid request to inspect data is made?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does address data retention limits and specifies that data is stored only as long as necessary for the purposes identified in the policy, including providing services, complying with legal obligations, and enforcing terms. It also mentions that certain data may be retained for legal reasons even after an account is deleted. However, the policy does not explicitly state that data retention will be limited unless a valid request to inspect data is made. This lack of explicit mention makes the policy only partially compliant with the GDPR requirement to limit data retention unless a valid request is made."
"40. **Deletion Purpose**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor will delete a user's personal information when the data are no longer necessary to fulfill its intended purpose?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does specify that the vendor will delete a user's personal information when it is no longer necessary to fulfill its intended purpose. For example, it states that ""we store information as long as necessary for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy,"" and ""when we no longer need to use the information to provide our Services, we delete or anonymize it."" However, the policy also mentions several exceptions where information may be retained for legal reasons, operational needs, or security purposes, which means that not all data will be deleted immediately when it is no longer necessary for its original purpose. This makes the policy only partially compliant with the GDPR requirement for data deletion."
"41. **User Deletion**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether a user can delete all their personal and non-personal information from the vendor?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy specifies that users can delete their WhatsApp account using the in-app delete account feature, which will result in the deletion of their information. However, it also mentions that certain information may be retained for legal reasons, operational needs, or for a limited time in backup storage. This means that while most personal information can be deleted, some data may still be retained under specific circumstances. Therefore, the policy is only partially compliant with the GDPR requirement for complete data deletion."
"42. **Deletion Process (BASIC)**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor provides a process for the school parent or eligible student to delete a student's personal information?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does specify a process for deleting personal information, but it does not explicitly mention a process specifically for a school parent or eligible student to delete a student's personal information. The policy outlines general procedures for deleting an account and the associated data, including the use of an in-app delete account feature and the retention of certain information for legal reasons. However, it lacks specific details about the deletion process for student data by a school parent or eligible student."
"43. **Deletion Notice**: ""Does the privacy policy specify how long the vendor may take to delete a user's data after notice is given?""","partially compliant

The privacy policy mentions that it takes up to 90 days to delete or de-identify WhatsApp information after the deletion process begins. However, it does not specify the exact time frame for the deletion process to start after notice is given. This lack of clarity on the initiation of the deletion process makes the policy only partially compliant with GDPR requirements for transparency in data deletion timelines."
"44. **User Export**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether a user can export or download their data including any user-created content on the product?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy mentions that users have the right to access, rectify, port, and erase their information, and it provides a feature called ""Request Account Info"" available in the app settings (Settings > Account). However, it does not explicitly state whether this includes user-created content such as messages, media, and other user-generated data. Therefore, while the policy addresses data portability in general, it lacks specific details about exporting or downloading user-created content."
"45. **Contractual Limits**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether a third-party successor of a data transfer is contractually required to provide the same privacy compliance required of the vendor?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy mentions that WhatsApp works with third-party service providers and requires them to use information on WhatsApp's behalf in accordance with instructions and terms. However, it does not explicitly state that a third-party successor of a data transfer is contractually required to provide the same privacy compliance required of the vendor. The policy does mention the use of Standard Contractual Clauses and other mechanisms to safeguard data transfers, but it lacks specific language about the obligations of third-party successors."
"46. **Verify Identity**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor or authorized third party verifies a user's identity with personal information?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy mentions that WhatsApp may verify a user's identity through various means, such as sending a verification code via SMS or calling, and using device verifiers. It also mentions the use of a PIN for two-step verification and email addresses for PIN reset. However, it does not explicitly state whether authorized third parties are involved in the identity verification process. Therefore, while the policy covers some aspects of identity verification, it lacks clarity on the involvement of third parties."
"47. **Security Agreement**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether a third party with access to a user's information is contractually required to provide the same level of security protections as the vendor?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy mentions that WhatsApp works with third-party service providers and requires them to use the information on WhatsApp's behalf in accordance with instructions and terms. However, it does not explicitly state that these third parties are contractually required to provide the same level of security protections as WhatsApp. The policy could be more explicit in detailing the security obligations imposed on third parties."
"48. **Reasonable Security (BASIC)**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether reasonable security standards are used to protect the confidentiality of a user's personal information?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy mentions that personal messages and calls are end-to-end encrypted, which is a strong security measure. However, it does not explicitly state that ""reasonable security standards"" are used to protect the confidentiality of a user's personal information in a broader sense. The policy could be more explicit about the general security standards and practices employed to protect user data beyond end-to-end encryption."
"49. **Transit Encryption (BASIC)**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether all data in transit is encrypted?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy specifies that personal messages and calls are end-to-end encrypted, meaning that no one, not even WhatsApp, can read or listen to them. However, it does not explicitly state that all data in transit is encrypted. The policy mentions encryption for specific types of data (e.g., messages, calls, media within messages, status information, and precise location information) but does not provide a blanket statement covering all data in transit. Therefore, while some data types are clearly protected, the policy does not confirm that all data in transit is encrypted."
"50. **Storage Encryption (BASIC)**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether all data at rest is encrypted?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy specifies that personal messages, calls, and media within messages are end-to-end encrypted and stored in encrypted form temporarily on servers. However, it does not explicitly state that all data at rest is encrypted. The policy mentions encryption in specific contexts but lacks a comprehensive statement about the encryption of all data at rest."
"51. **Data Control**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether personal information is stored outside the control of the vendor?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does mention that information is transferred, transmitted, stored, and processed outside the European Economic Area (EEA), including in the United States and other third countries. It also specifies the mechanisms used for these transfers, such as Adequacy Decisions, the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and Standard Contractual Clauses. However, it does not explicitly state whether personal information is stored outside the control of the vendor (WhatsApp). The policy could be clearer on this point to ensure full compliance with GDPR requirements regarding data control and storage."
"52. **Breach Notice (BASIC)**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor provides notice to affected individuals in the event of a data breach?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does not explicitly mention providing notice to affected individuals in the event of a data breach. While it discusses various aspects of data protection, processing, and sharing information with authorities, it lacks a clear statement on breach notification to individuals. Under GDPR, notifying affected individuals in the event of a data breach is a requirement, so the policy should explicitly address this to be fully compliant."
"53. **Security Audit**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor's data privacy or security practices are audited to ensure compliance?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does not explicitly mention whether the vendor's data privacy or security practices are audited to ensure compliance. While the policy does detail various security measures and compliance with legal obligations, it lacks specific information about regular audits or assessments of these practices. This omission means the policy is only partially compliant with GDPR requirements regarding transparency and accountability in data protection practices."
"54. **Data Profile (BASIC)**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether third parties can use a student's data to create an automated profile engage in data enhancement conduct social advertising or target advertising to students parents teachers or the school?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does mention that WhatsApp works with third-party service providers to help provide services and that these providers may receive certain types of information. However, it does not explicitly state whether third parties can use a student's data to create an automated profile, engage in data enhancement, conduct social advertising, or target advertising to students, parents, teachers, or the school. The policy does mention the use of data for business intelligence and analytics, but it lacks specific details on the use of data for profiling or targeted advertising. Therefore, the policy is partially compliant as it provides some information but lacks the necessary specificity regarding the use of student data by third parties for the purposes mentioned in the question."
"55. **Unsubscribe Marketing**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether a user can opt out or unsubscribe from vendor or third-party marketing communications?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy mentions that users can object to direct marketing and opt out of future direct marketing messages using the unsubscribe link in communications or the in-app ""block"" feature. However, it does not explicitly address whether users can opt out or unsubscribe from vendor or third-party marketing communications specifically. This lack of specificity makes the policy only partially compliant with GDPR requirements regarding clear and comprehensive information on opting out of all types of marketing communications."
"56. **School Contract**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor provides a contract to a Local Educational Agency (LEA) or otherwise provides notice to users of additional rights?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does not explicitly mention providing a contract to a Local Educational Agency (LEA) or providing notice to users of additional rights in the context of a school contract. However, the policy does discuss various legal bases for processing information, user rights, and how users can exercise those rights. This indicates some level of compliance with GDPR requirements for transparency and user rights, but it does not specifically address the scenario involving an LEA or additional rights in a school context."
"57. **Parental Consent (BASIC)**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor or third party obtains verifiable parental consent before collecting or disclosing personal information?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy mentions a minimum age requirement for using WhatsApp in the European Region, which has been reduced from 16 to 13 years. However, it does not explicitly state whether verifiable parental consent is obtained before collecting or disclosing personal information for users under the age of 16. This is a requirement under GDPR for processing the personal data of children under 16, unless a lower age limit (not below 13) is set by the member state. Therefore, while the policy addresses age requirements, it lacks specific details on obtaining parental consent, making it only partially compliant."
"58. **Withdraw Consent**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor responds to a parent's or guardian's request to stop collecting their child's information?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does mention that users have the right to withdraw consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. However, it does not specifically address whether the vendor responds to a parent's or guardian's request to stop collecting their child's information. The policy does mention a minimum age requirement for using WhatsApp, but it lacks explicit details on handling parental or guardian requests regarding their child's data."
"59. **Privacy Badge**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor has signed any privacy pledges or received privacy certifications?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy mentions that WhatsApp LLC and Meta Platforms, Inc. are certified participants in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and rely on the European Commission's adequacy decision for data transfers. However, it does not specify whether the vendor has signed any other privacy pledges or received additional privacy certifications beyond this framework."
"60. **GDPR Jurisdiction**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether a user's data are subject to international data transfer or jurisdiction laws such as a privacy shield or safe harbor framework?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy does specify that user data may be subject to international data transfers and mentions mechanisms such as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and Standard Contractual Clauses. However, it does not mention the Privacy Shield or Safe Harbor frameworks, which are outdated and no longer valid under GDPR. The policy should be updated to reflect current and valid data transfer mechanisms only."
"61. **GDPR Role**: ""Does the privacy policy specify whether the vendor is a Data Controller or Data Processor and whether a Data Protection Officer (DPO) has been identified for GDPR compliance?""","**partially compliant**

The privacy policy specifies that WhatsApp Ireland Limited is the entity providing services in the European Region, which implies it acts as a Data Controller. However, the policy does not explicitly state whether WhatsApp is a Data Controller or Data Processor. Additionally, the policy mentions that a Data Protection Officer (DPO) can be contacted for questions regarding the privacy policy, but it does not provide specific details about the DPO's role or responsibilities. Therefore, while some information is provided, it is not comprehensive enough to be fully compliant with GDPR requirements."
